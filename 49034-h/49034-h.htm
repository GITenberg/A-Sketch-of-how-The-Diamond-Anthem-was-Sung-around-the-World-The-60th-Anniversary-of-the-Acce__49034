<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='bold'>Sunday, 20th June, 1897.</span></p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>Being an extract from the Annual Report of the Supreme Grand President</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>of the Sons of England, given at St. Catharines,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>Canada, 8th March, 1898.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>18. It has been my happy lot to be the President of the Sons of
England during the record year of Her Majesty’s reign, an epoch year
in the history of our British Empire, and it has given me the intensest
pleasure to devote whatever power lay within me toward sustaining the
loyal sentiments which have been evoked in so remarkable a degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Foreign nations were amazed at the wondrous attachment with
which the subjects of Queen Victoria, at home and all over the world,
joined in rejoicing over her welfare, and in attesting their loyalty to
her person and her Crown, but the Jubilee home-coming was a revelation
also to the people of the Home Land, who found thus vividly
brought before their eyes the marvellous area over which our fathers
and we who had emigrated from her shores, have spread her power,
and at last have seemed to “understand” how real is the blood union
existing between the Sons who have gone out into the world, and the
Brothers who have remained at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summoned by the magic call of the Empress Queen, “Greater
Britain” has suddenly stepped forward on the field as an actual and
integral part of her Realm and Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Grand Lodge at
Brantford, an address, most beautifully and appropriately illuminated,
was forwarded to Her Majesty conveying our devotion, and stating the
belief “that the personality of the Crown is the strongest and most
stable bond of union between the millions of people who spread in a
world-embracing circle around the old Home-Kingdom, delight in
proving faithful allegiance, and doing loyal service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Society also joined heartily with all other societies in testifying
together with them our united affection and loyalty upon the 22nd
of June, the officially appointed Jubilee day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to me, however, that the Sons of England owed it to
their Queen, and earnestly desired to do something more, and I therefore
organized the “<span class='it'>Jubilee Service of a continuous anthem around
the world</span>,” to take place on Sunday, the 20th of June, the actual
anniversary day of Her Majesty’s accession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea when first mooted met with immediate acceptance as a
happy conception, but many doubts were expressed as to the possibility
of its being actually accomplished, for it seemed to the faint-hearted
almost an impossibility to arrange for a connecting line of
services, which should take place in succession around the whole circle
of the earth for the space of twenty-four hours. Yet I have much
pleasure in informing Supreme Grand Lodge that the “<span class='it'>continuous
Anthem and Prayer offered</span>,” as stated in the Official Circular issued by
me on the 8th April, “<span class='it'>as the loyal and affectionate tribute of the Sons
of England to their Gracious Queen upon the Diamond Jubilee of her
accession to the Throne</span>,” has been carried out in actual fact, and in
completest detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible within the limits of this report to give more
than a sketch, but some record is due of a “service” which was so
universally and ardently adopted, which is absolutely unique in history,
and which, moreover, is one capable of being carried out only by our
nation, upon whose Sovereign’s dominions the sun never sets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intention was that commencing from the hour of 4.05 in the
morning at Windsor Castle on the 20th of June, the Sons in the
Colonies should join in a world-wide carol, and encircle their Queen
with the continuous singing of the National Anthem all through the
hours of that great day of her life, and on through the night until
daylight the next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the opposite side of the world from the Heart of the Empire at
Windsor Castle are the <span class='it'>Fiji Islands</span>, the colony situate nearest to
longitude 180, where it is 4 o’clock in the afternoon at the same
moment at which it is 4 o’clock in the morning of the same day in
England at Greenwich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The problem was therefore to have the National Anthem commenced
in Fiji at the beginning of Her Majesty’s day, and sung
thereafter precisely at 4 p.m., as the sun arrived at that moment in
succession over each place in the Colonies, and passed onwards around
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A form of service was devised suitable for any Sunday afternoon
service, to commence at 3.30, in which the National Anthem should
be sung at the appointed moment of 4 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full descriptive circulars, forms of service, and a time-table of
longitudes, prepared by the Meteorological Department of Canada, and
showing the meridian or sun time at each place, were sent in multitude
to friends and correspondents in every Colony and Dependency
owning allegiance to the Union Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the co-operation of the Right Rev. The Bishop of Toronto,
who is a member of our Order, communications were opened up with
all the Colonial bishops and clergy, and their services were enlisted.
Patriotic societies and the secretaries of the Royal Colonial Institute
were asked by me to assist. Letters were sent to the captains of every
British passenger ship which would be at sea on the 20th of June,
asking them to sing the Anthem, fire a gun, and note the position of
their ship at 4 p.m. on that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our own brethren in Newfoundland and Canada and patriots in the
United States took the service up with energy and enthusiasm. The
Sons of England in South Africa answered with alacrity, Australia and
New Zealand joined in heartily, and thus, by prompt and efficient
action, the organization was completed and ready for the eventful
day. Copies of the time-table were sent to Her Majesty, by reference
to which it could be seen at any hour how far the Anthem had proceeded
on its way and in what colony it was at any moment being
sung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In acknowledging receipt the Colonial Secretary, The Right Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain, says to His Excellency Lord Aberdeen: “I have
the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of the 24th
April with its enclosures on the subject of the Continuous Service
around the World which is being arranged by the Sons of England in
commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of the Queen’s Accession to
the Throne. I have to inform you that, in accordance with your
request, the matter has been brought before the notice of the Queen,
and that Her Majesty was graciously pleased to express her sincere
appreciation of the loyal feelings that have prompted this interesting
method of Commemoration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 20th of June came and the Anthem passed around the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reports and letters kept coming in month after month in reply to
my request and giving an account of the proceedings held in each
place. A few extracts only can be give here as samples of many
hundreds of similar character which have been received from the
continuous line now recorded around the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The service commenced on Sunday afternoon 20th June in
Levuka, Fiji Islands. Dr. Garner Jones, headmaster of the Levuka
Public Schools, writes: “Owing to geographical position—viz., 178.51
E. long.—the inhabitants of Levuka, Fiji Islands, enjoyed the
unique honor of initiating “The Wave of Song” that hailed the
Jubilee (Diamond) of Her Majesty’s Ascension, a wave which travelled
from colony to colony in order of longitude, encircling the entire
globe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The service was an open air one, being held in the Government
school grounds, Rev. W. Floyd, vicar of the Episcopal English Church
officiating. The attendance was large and included representatives of
various races who claim Her Majesty as their Sovereign. English,
Scotch, Irish, Australian and New Zealand Colonials, Chinese, Germans,
Swedes, among whom the characteristic bushy hair of the
Fijian and other South Sea Islanders was prominent, there found
themselves shoulder to shoulder in the antipodes of the British
Empire earnestly rolling forth our grand old National Anthem, thus
giving the keynote of thanksgiving to the entire world. The Masons
and Odd Fellows appeared in regalia and the Levuka brass band was
in attendance. Surrounding the main body of the assembly were the
Levuka school boys, drawn up with their wooden rifles at the “Order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Punctually at five minutes to 4 o’clock the procession of
choristers left their temporary vestry and slowly approached their
stand. At 4 o’clock precisely, meridian time, the British Ensign
was hoisted, which was the pre-arranged signal, the band immediately
struck up and every throat commenced ‘God Save the Queen’ while
the public school guard stood at the ‘Present.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly the occasion was unique, and Levuka never forgot
for a moment that her geographical position was unique also, in so
far as she enjoyed the proud distinction of being allowed to start the
wave of song which in its course would pass over in rotation all the
British possessions on the face of the globe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that same time, and while Her Majesty slept at 4.05 a.m. at
Windsor, the Executive of the Sons of England and Lodge Commercial
were in meeting at Shaftesbury Hall, Toronto. Precisely at 10.55 p.m.,
on Saturday 19th, they sang the National Anthem, commenced that
same moment on Sunday afternoon in Levuka, and which for the next
17¼ hours was to be coming steadily nearer with the sun until it was
over Toronto at 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, when the Sons of England
in Toronto again joined in the loyal strain as it pushed by them
onwards toward the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three minutes after Levuka had commenced, Suva, the Fiji
capital, took up the strain. Mr. Hamilton Hunter says: “I am glad
to report that the Special Jubilee Service was a great success in this
Colony. It was not merely confined to the English Church but was
heartily taken up by the Roman Catholics, Presbyterian and Wesleyan
Churches. The National Anthem was sung on the stroke of four.
I have to thank you for having enabled us to set ‘The Wave of Song’
in motion by your timely warning, and I can assure you that though
our numbers are small and consequently the volume of sound was less
than in larger colonies, yet the loyalty shown in Fiji to Her Most
Gracious Majesty on the 60th anniversary of her reign, could not
have been exceeded in any other part of the Empire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nineteen minutes later, or before the services in the Fijis had
closed, the Anthem was taken up, in Napier, New Zealand. The report
says, “The Jubilee services at the cathedral yesterday will be
remembered by the Napier people for many a long year, and it is questionable
whether a more imposing ecclesiastical spectacle was ever
witnessed in New Zealand. The cathedral was crowded to excess, all
the friendly societies of Napier being present.” The Dean writes:
“As Dean of the easternmost Cathedral in the British Empire, the
cathedral upon which the rays of the rising sun first fall, I have to
report that, in accordance with your wishes, we commenced the
great circle of Anthem singing, as arranged for by the Sons of England,
at 4 o’clock on the afternoon of Sunday last. The service was a very
magnificent and enthusiastic one. I convey my most hearty good
wishes to you, and to the members of the great organization you
represent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wave swept across Australia. At Melbourne, Victoria, B.
Cowderoy, Esq., Secretary R.C.I., reports: “Both cathedrals (Anglican
and Roman Catholic) were crushingly full. In the Exhibition building
several thousands, after addresses by leading Wesleyans, took up the
National Anthem at our standard time. In the town hall the Anthem
was sung with fervor at 4 p.m. by 4,000 voices with most impressive
effect. I am an octogenarian, but in this matter I am as young as my
eight grandsons, and thank you, Mr. Cumberland, for your happy
suggestion which has given added interest to all that is being done.”
Adelaide, S. Australia: “The Bishops of the Diocese entered heartily
into the scheme. The Governor and his staff were present. The
National Anthem was sung with intense fervor and most thrilling
effect.” So it passed through the other cities and over the continent
of Australia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the Indian Ocean. <span class='it'>Empress of India</span> marked the lat. 26.6.
n.; long. 120. 26. e. “Rockets fired and National Anthem sung
at 4 p.m. off Alligator Rock.” It first touched Africa and was hailed
by the lodge of the Sons of England at Durban, Natal, and then, in continuing
line across South Africa, in all the principal cities and Cape
Town, the record was maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the Atlantic Ocean it was taken up on many British ships at
sea, among whom a few only may be mentioned. R.M.S. <span class='it'>Tantallon
Castle</span>, lat. 7. 17. n.; long. 14. 33. w., off west coast of Africa: “Guns
fired and Anthem sung at 4 p.m. S.S. <span class='it'>Greek</span>, lat. 18. 10. n.; long.
17. 38. w.: “Fired rocket and sang National Anthem.” S.S. <span class='it'>Numidian</span>:
“God Save the Queen sung precisely at 4 p.m.;” ship’s position,
lat. 54. 42.; long. 20. 43. w. S.S. <span class='it'>Catalonia</span>: “At 4 p.m. I had two
explosive gun signals fired on my ship in lat. 50. 12. n.; long. 22. 6. w.
It was blowing a south-west gale with high seas, and it was a great
disappointment to me that we could not hold the service I had
intended, but all classes of passengers were so sea-sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the equivalent time of 7.31 p.m. at Windsor Castle the Anthem
had crossed the Atlantic, and first touched the shores at St. John’s, Newfoundland,
when it was met by Lodge Dudley, S.O.E., assembled,
together with the Governor-General and all the friendly societies in
the Cathedral. “The service was impressive in the extreme.” From
here westward through Canada I need not dilate how that as the sun
crossed the continent the line through the villages, towns and cities of
Canada was so complete that the singing of the Anthem in one place
had not ceased before it was taken up in the next. As says the report
from Orillia, “as the familiar words were sung with lusty fervor by
nearly a thousand voices, until the volume almost raised the roof, the
sun passed the hour of four. In imagination the congregation could
hear the strains as they rolled up from the east and died away into
the west.” At Toronto, 3,000 people were packed into the Cathedral.
After completion of the prayers there remained four minutes before it
was our turn to take our place in the circle of song. By direction of
His Lordship, the Bishop, the congregation knelt in silent prayer for
Her Majesty and the welfare of the Empire. An immense throng of
6,000 to 7,000 people filled the grounds and the adjacent streets outside,
and a Regimental Band had been stationed on the Cathedral
steps to lead their singing. At the stroke of the Cathedral bell, which
had been arranged to ring at 4.18 p.m., being the real meridian time
for 4 p.m. at Toronto, the congregation rose and joined with those
outside in uplifting with heart and voice their loyal prayer, “<span class='it'>God save
our gracious Queen</span>.” Those were moments of a life-time while we
waited in silence for the coming of the anthem. Thus actually minute
after minute the Anthem strain followed the hours across this continent
to the shores of the Pacific at Victoria, British Columbia, where
an open-air service was held at the equivalent of 12.13 midnight at
Windsor Castle. “Among those present at Beacon Hill Park were the
Lieut.-Governor, the Mayor, the Admiral and officers of the ships in
harbor. At 4 o’clock the bugles rang out, the royal standard was run
up to the masthead, and the National Anthem was sung with full
force by an assemblage of 12,000 people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From here, leaving the land, the Anthem wafted its way back to
the place of beginning, being joined as it passed by the S.S. <span class='it'>Aorangi</span>,
in lat. 32. 25. n.; long. 147. 49. w., and by the <span class='it'>Empress of China</span>, lat.
41. 16. n; long. 152. 30. w., until at length it came to the little island,
which is as far on one side of long. 180, the central degree of longitude,
a Levuka from where it had started is on the other. Here the West
had met the East. I will give the last letter, as it deserves, in full,
from the lighthouse-keeper on the island:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:left;margin-left:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Wailagilala Lighthouse, Fiji</span>,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>“17 South, 179.6, West Long.,</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>“26th September, 1897.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>,—As you expressed a wish in your circular to hear
how the anniversary of the day on which Her Majesty began her happy
reign was observed in each locality, and also on board passenger ships
at sea, I hope you will be pleased to hear that all your instructions
were carried out here, as fully as circumstances permitted, my situation
here being unique. As this is the connecting link between the western
and eastern hemispheres, it may happen that you will find by overlooking
the places where the ceremony was observed, that my endeavors
were successful in commencing or finishing the general celebration
of the world. Being only 54 minutes west of the meridian, all ships
passing either way ought to change the name of the day on their
reckoning while within sight of this island. I obtained the correct
astronomical time from the captain and officers of the steamer that
calls here every three months. A doubt being expressed about the
proper day, and as good action could not be performed too often,
I observed both the 20th and 21st June in the same way. I also
had a bonfire lit on both nights, so that ships passing either eastward
or westward could see that the anniversary was being kept to suit
either contingency. I would have written you earlier but there has
been no means of communication between this island since the 16th
of June last until to-day.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Alfred Ffrench</span>,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'><span class='it'>Lighthouse-keeper</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here the circle of the world was complete and the Anthem had
come back to the place of its beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus have we Sons of England linked our fellow-colonists hand
in hand in one continuous line around the world, and changed the
ideal but historic “drumbeat” of the “Martial airs of England”
into the absolute fact of the “<span class='it'>Diamond Anthem</span>” with which we
have encircled the earth, and accompanied the hours throughout the
Diamond Jubilee Accession Day of our beloved Queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the great records of Her Majesty’s Reign is the marvellous
increase of her Colonial Kingdom; it is largely through her own
personal influence that during those sixty years it has been extended
and cared for. Gladly has this tribute of affection been given by her
grateful Colonists to their Queen by thus joining together in their
rejoicings in a way, “<span class='it'>Hands All Round</span>,” which was impossible at the
beginning of her reign, but which she has by her broad-minded
advance, herself made practicable, and which therefore has marked a
record of her great life work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion I express my thanks to the Staff of the Head Office
for their cheerful aid in the vastly increased correspondence entailed
by the Jubilee Work, to our own District Deputies and officers, and to
the officers and members of other Societies and to the members of the
Clergy for the efficient and enthusiastic arrangements they made for
the Sons of England service in their separate localities. I hope and
feel that our united labours will have been for the strengthening of
our patriotism, the awakening of new energies for Union and the
deepening of British interests throughout our Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trusting that my actions through the year will have received
your approval,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:14em;'>I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>Yours faithfully and fraternally,</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
